title: Started working in a HTML5 One Page Site.
---

So far i've done the standard website with an index and that shit load of files: modules.html, contact.html, about-us.html and all that jeez. Now i've taken a job from somebody i've known for quite a while, he needed a site for his door-to-door delivery from Miami, FL to Valencia, Venezuela.

I decided to make a one-page website because he seems to be one of those who'd like to have it looking awesome in his phone (Applemaniac), so i looked out for some guidance on how to carry on with this job.

I've done it brilliantly good. It lacks of a way of sending mails, because gh-pages wouldn't allow you to send mails directly from their host, so i have to tweak it out and use some sort of outside contact form.

I will post pictures of the final product as soon as i finish it.

Have a nice day.
