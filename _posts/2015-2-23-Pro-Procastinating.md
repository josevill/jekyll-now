title: I've been feeling too lazy in the last weeks
---

I never (ever) turn off my personal computer. I like that feel when i wake up at any time of the day and jump in to my chair a.k.a throne and start my day reading some reddit, or watching some video in youtube.

Whenever i'm on my throne, i do any kind of stuff when sitting there. (Alright, almost any kind) I play [osu!](http://osu.ppy.sh/u/josevill), [Starcraft 2](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/profile/4100531/1/llllIlIIIlll/), maybe some Tetris online, program some random crap for L2j (Lineage 2 Server Emulator) or Ragnarok Online's eAthena (Good ol' Ragnarok Online server Emulator).

In the time being, i've jumped around my chrome tabs at least for 20 mins, totally stopped writing or thinking about what i was going to write here. So i decided to install this [magical tool, Procasti-Tracker](http://strlen.com/procrastitracker/).
